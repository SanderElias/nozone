Volunteer: Hey Sander
Me: Hi!
Volunteer: I have this issue. We have a customer that asks for a visualization. So, can you build that?
Me: Sure! hand me the design specification, and I'll get right to it.
Volunteer: euhm, yes, Well, they have a data-source that emits a value every 20Ms, and they want to follow along
Me: Oh well. And how am I supposed to do that? Pile up a stack of boxes?
Volunteer: That sounds like a good idea!
Me: Ok I will get to work.

10 minutes later

Me: Hiya, I have something to show.
Volunteer: What took you so long?
Me: The coffee-machine broke down, I had to get out to get fuel, euh coffee.

Here I show the "product" and talk about the code.

Me: So, [volunteer] is this something you can work with.
Volunteer: Yes, I will take it to the customer.
me: Great!
Volunteer: Hey, I'm back from the customer. They really liked it.
me: good, so now I can go on with my work?
Volunteer: Yeah, euhm you know, they liked the boxes a lot, but were wondering if you could make it a line graph, and add some numbers and so. you know..
Me: <sighs> I know, i know..
